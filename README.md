# boilerplate-phaser

Boilerplate to use Phaser Framework with ES6.

Check the `src` folder and start working on your project from there. WIth this boilerplate you can use

- classes
- import/export
- spread/rest

We're not currently able to use async/await, cause I thought it's not needed for a starting point. But if you need it, create an Issue in the repo.

## Development

`yarn dev` will start the project in localhost:8080

## Build

`yarn build` will build the project to be deployed
